# DataViz-Project-KUL-23


A sveltekit application using different visuals is developed for this project.


The data is derived from the 2021 VAST (Visual Analytics in Science and Technology) competition. In this competition, participants were asked to identify aberrant behaviour by employees of a (fictitious) company named GAStech which was involved in environment pollution on a (fictitious) Greek island. This included getting a handle on where employees were during a two-week period.
